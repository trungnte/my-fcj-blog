> [!TIP]
> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Regularly review your usage patterns in the Budget history to identify trends and optimize your resource allocation. Consider setting up multiple usage budgets for different services to gain comprehensive visibility into your AWS consumption.

> [!CAUTION]
> 🔒 **Security Note**: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to budget information, as it can reveal details about your infrastructure scale and resource allocation.
